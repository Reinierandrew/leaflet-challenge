### Earthquakes

Earthquakes are a natural phenomenon caused by the movement of tectonic plates beneath the Earth's surface. These sudden movements can cause the ground to shake and can result in significant damage and loss of life. The severity of an earthquake is typically measured on the Richter scale, which ranges from 1 to 10, with each increase in number representing a tenfold increase in seismic energy released. While earthquakes can occur at any time and in any location, some areas are more prone to seismic activity than others. This is particularly true along fault lines, where tectonic plates meet and are more likely to shift and cause earthquakes. Unfortunately, the devastation caused by earthquakes can be significant, particularly in areas with poor infrastructure and building codes. Despite advances in technology and earthquake prediction, earthquakes remain a significant natural disaster and continue to pose a threat to human life and infrastructure.

The below map represents the earthquakes above the Richter scale of 4.5 for the year 2023 to date with an additional tectonic plates layer. There have been some devastating earthquakes in 2023 above the Richter scale of 6.5 which are shown in an additional layer.

This was produced for an assignment using data from the USGS . USGS provides earthquake data , updated every 5 minutes and their GeoJSON Feed Links are used as the source data. Using D3 and leaflet the data is structured to produce the below map with various layers.
